I was expecting either a dull, Bourne - style spy thriller, with pointless noise and racing around, or a smug, 'aren't we cleverly spoofing the 60s' superficiality but actually this is quite an enjoyable, stylish piece. My 13 year old complained for the first few minutes then was hooked! The characters are pretty simplistic, yes, but great to watch, and the chemistry between all the three leads works well. You do find yourself caring what happens to them which is a good sign. The plot is no dafter than most Bond films, and a couple of nice twists kept it interesting. The chases are low key which made them more involving to watch than the overdone exploits of recent Bond films, for example, and its definitely worth a look.
